# Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!
My name is Shawn, currently an O Level student. Looking to study Data Science in the future.

## Projects
### [Free-response Survey Processing](https://github.com/cereal-is-a-soup/Open-ended-Response-Processing)

 - Processed responses from open-ended survey questions to find out where students aspire to progress to for post-secondary education.
 - Used natural language processing to clean responses and tag with categories.
 - Allowed for analysis on a large scale. **1000+ responses over 4 years**
