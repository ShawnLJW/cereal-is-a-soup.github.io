# Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!
My name is Shawn, currently an O Level student. Looking to study Data Science in the future. I seek to understand the things I like, so this page shows some of what I've done to learn data science.

## Projects
### [Free-response Survey Processing](https://github.com/cereal-is-a-soup/Open-ended-Response-Processing)

 - Processed responses from open-ended survey questions to find out where students aspire to progress to for post-secondary education.
 - Used natural language processing to clean responses and tag with categories.
 - Allowed for analysis on a large scale. **1000+ responses over 4 years**

### [Where Has The Time Gone](https://github.com/cereal-is-a-soup/WhereHasTheTimeGone)
- Top-down shooter inspired by SUPERHOT. Time only moves when you move.
- Fun gameplay, try to out the hordes of enemies with your abilities.
- Simplistic but immersive design.
