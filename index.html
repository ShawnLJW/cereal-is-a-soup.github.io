                <h1>My story so far:</h1>
                <p>I am a student from Commonwealth Secondary School. Subjects I take include Computing, A-Math and Physics.</p>
                <p>I want to be someone people look for when problems appear, someone who can make a difference. Data science and artificial intelligence are my tools to accomplish this.</p>
                <p>Coding was something I started at a young age, when my father taught me simple scripting languages like lua. Since then, I have been interested in practical applications of technology. Now I mainly use python for managing data and building machine learning models.</p>
